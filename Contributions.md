# Contribution Guidelines

Welcome to the project! This document outlines the workflow and best practices for contributing to the application. Following these guidelines will help maintain code quality, streamline development, and ensure smooth deployments.

## **Branching Strategy**

The repository uses a structured branching strategy to separate development stages:

1. **Feature Branches**:
   - Name your feature branch descriptively, e.g., `feature/add-login`, `bugfix/fix-api-error`.
   - Work on individual features or fixes in isolated branches.
   - Push changes regularly to the feature branch.

2. **Staging Branch**:
   - After tests pass, merge feature branches into `staging`.
   - Used for integration and staging tests.

3. **Main Branch**:
   - Production-ready code only.
   - Merge into `main` after staging validation is complete.
   - Changes merged into `main` are automatically deployed to production.

---

## **Development Workflow**

1. **Create a Feature Branch**:
   - Pull the latest changes from `main` and `staging`.
   - Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`.

2. **Develop Locally**:
   - Write code and ensure local tests pass.
   - Use tools like linters and type checkers for code quality.

3. **Push Changes**:
   - Push your branch to the remote repository: `git push origin feature/your-feature-name`.
   - Open a pull request (PR) against `staging`.

4. **Run CI Tests**:
   - Automated tests (unit tests, linters, etc.) will run on the PR.
   - Fix any issues flagged by the CI pipeline.

5. **Merge to Staging**:
   - Once all tests pass and code is reviewed, merge the feature branch into `staging`.

6. **Staging Tests**:
   - Deploy the `staging` branch to the staging environment.
   - Run integration and end-to-end tests.
   - Validate application behavior under near-production conditions.

7. **Merge to Main**:
   - If staging tests pass, merge `staging` into `main`.
   - Deployment to production will be triggered automatically.

## **Code Quality Standards**

To maintain a consistent codebase, adhere to the following:

1. **Linting**:
   - Use `flake8` for Python to enforce style consistency.
   - Fix all linting errors before committing.

2. **Type Checking**:
   - Use `mypy` to check for type errors in Python.

3. **Testing**:
   - Write unit tests for all new features.
   - Ensure existing tests pass before submitting a PR.
   - Run tests locally using `pytest`.

4. **Commit Messages**:
   - Use clear, descriptive messages.
   - Format: `<type>: <description>`
     - Example: `feature: add user authentication`

## **Pull Request Guidelines**

1. **PR Checklist**:
   - The feature branch is up-to-date with `staging`.
   - Code passes all automated tests.
   - Code has been reviewed.

2. **Review Process**:
   - Reviewers check for code quality, correctness, and adherence to guidelines.
   - Address all comments before merging.

3. **Merge Policy**:
   - Squash commits when merging to keep the history clean.
   - Only merge after all checks pass.

---

## **Deployment Workflow**

1. **Staging Deployment**:
   - Automatically triggered on updates to the `staging` branch.
   - Deployed with the tag `staging` to Docker Cloud.

2. **Production Deployment**:
   - Automatically triggered on updates to the `main` branch.
   - Deployed with the tag `latest` to Docker Cloud.

3. **Post-Deployment Validation**:
   - Monitor health checks and logs.
   - Roll back if issues are identified.

---

## **FAQs**

1. **What if tests fail on my PR?**
   - Fix the flagged issues locally and push the changes to the same branch. The tests will rerun automatically.

2. **What if I need help?**
   - Reach out via the project’s communication channel (e.g., Slack or GitHub Discussions).
