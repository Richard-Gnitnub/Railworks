# **🚀 Feature Implementation Plan**

## **Overview**
This document outlines the planned features, their priorities, and dependencies to ensure smooth implementation of the CAD pipeline and API integration.

---

## **📌 Planned Features & Changes**
| **Feature**         | **Task** | **Priority** | **Why It’s Important?** | **Dependencies?** |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------|------------------|
| **Caching for API Responses** | Implement **Memcached** for API endpoints. | 🔥 High | Reduces DB queries, improves performance. | Memcached installed. |
| **Django Admin Views** | Create admin views for **Assembly, NMRAStandard, ExportedFile, Parameter**. | 🔥 High | Allows easy manual database management. | None. |
| **Soft Deletion** | Implement `is_deleted=True` instead of hard deletes. | 🔥 High | Prevents accidental data loss. | Admin views. |
| **Auto-Purge After 90 Days** | Automatically remove soft-deleted records. | ⚠️ Medium | Prevents DB clutter, keeps system clean. | Soft delete system. |
| **CAD Pipeline DB Integration** | Replace YAML files with **database-driven** parameters. | 🔥 High | Makes system dynamic & scalable. | API modifications. |
| **New API Endpoints** | Introduce APIs for **tile, wall, track generation**. | 🔥 High | Enables real-time CAD generation. | Database integration. |
| **Validation Rules** | Ensure strict API validation for **all requests**. | 🔥 High | Prevents bad data from breaking CAD pipeline. | None. |
| **Validation Logging** | Log failed validation requests in the database. | 🔥 High | Helps debug API failures, improves monitoring. | Validation system. |
| **Auto-Delete Validation Logs** | Remove logs **older than 90 days**. | ⚠️ Medium | Keeps database clean. | Logging system. |
| **Testing Strategy** | Write tests for **API, database, soft delete, caching**. | 🔥 High | Ensures system stability before scaling. | All previous tasks. |
| **Future Celery Integration** | Prepare for **asynchronous task processing** (long-running exports). | 🚀 Future | Needed when export tasks take longer. | Not required yet. |

---

## **📌 Next Steps**
🚀 **We are now ready to:**
✅ **Implement caching, soft deletion, and API-driven CAD pipeline.**  
✅ **Integrate validation logging & automatic cleanup for errors.**  
✅ **Prepare structured API testing & future Celery-based exports.**
