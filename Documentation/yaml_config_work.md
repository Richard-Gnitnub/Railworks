# **Progress Summary and Next Steps**

## **Summary of Today's Progress**

### 1. **YAML Integration**
- Integrated YAML configurations into `flemish_brick_tile.py` for defining brick and mortar dimensions dynamically.
- Created a `configs/` directory to store `default_config.yaml` and other configuration files.

### 2. **Script Refactoring**
- Updated key functions (`create_full_brick_aligned`, `create_half_brick_aligned`, `create_mortar_row_layer`) to accept dimensions dynamically.
- Replaced hardcoded values with YAML-loaded parameters for flexibility.

### 3. **Enhanced Testing**
- Developed a comprehensive test suite in `test_flemish_brick_tile.py` to validate:
  - YAML configuration loading and validation.
  - Geometry generation using parameterized tests for bricks and mortar rows.
  - Export functionality for STEP and STL files.
  - Handling edge cases like invalid directories and empty tiles.
- Achieved 100% test pass rate, with minor deprecation warnings logged for monitoring.

### 4. **Validation**
- Successfully executed the script, confirming STEP and STL file exports to the correct directories.
- Monitored tests and script behavior for potential issues or areas for improvement.

## **Next Steps**

### 1. **Expand YAML Configuration**
- Add support for additional parameters:
  - **Tile alignment offsets**.
  - **Row repetition** for larger assemblies.
  - **Export format options**, such as OBJ or additional CAD types.

### 2. **Integrate into the CAD Pipeline**
- Connect the tile generation module into the larger CAD pipeline.
- Plan how components like walls, roofs, and chimneys interact dynamically with tiles.

### 3. **API Enhancements**
- Implement API endpoints using **Django Ninja** for:
  - Submitting YAML configurations.
  - Triggering tile generation and file exports.
- Develop user-friendly API responses and documentation.

### 4. **Documentation Updates**
- Update project documentation to include:
  - **YAML integration** details.
  - **Testing framework** and coverage explanation.
  - **Export functionality** examples and use cases.
  - Sample YAML configuration files.

### 5. **Future Features**
- Explore assembling larger objects (e.g., lineside huts) by combining tiles, walls, and other components.
- Implement **caching mechanisms** for intermediate solids to optimize computation times.
